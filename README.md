# FamilyDoctor
This is a web application that allows doctors to add a patient and create a medical record for them. The doctor will be able to access the patient's medical record and update it after each visit

This repository contains the source code that uses the Spring Framework, Lombok, the SQL driver, and Spring Validation to build an online medical record management system. The system allows patients to make an online appointment with their family doctor and allows the doctor to retrieve his patient's medical record.
